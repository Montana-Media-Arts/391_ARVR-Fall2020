# Share your experience

What is the purpose and why are you sharing it?  Make sure you have a clear reason as to why you created the application and why you are sharing it with another person.  Communicating this is important.  Too often, we create "cool" technological things but with no real purpose.  They should all say something.

Send your application to someone else and get feedback.

10 mins share your app with someone, have them test it and them use your test document.
