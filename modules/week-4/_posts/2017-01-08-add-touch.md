# Add Touch Recognition

The last part is adding to the script so that the object appears only when the screen is touched.

```csharp
 if(Input.touchCount > 0)

        {
            // how do we get it to place after we have touched the screen?
            // how do we get multiple objects to show up?
        }
        

```
