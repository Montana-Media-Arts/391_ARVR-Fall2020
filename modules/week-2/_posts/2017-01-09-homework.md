# Homework

Make sure you have a working example of at least 1 experience by Wednesday. Be ready to display your experience by video and talk about why you chose your example and how you see it fitting into the AR landscape.

This week is an introduction to Augmented Reality. Read about Augmented Reality and think about its uses.

1. Create two short AR experiences using at least 2 of the AR examples.  Make a recording of them.
2. Write a short paper (1/2 page) on the different types of markers that might be useful when you look out in the world.  Why would you use one over another?
3. Upload your document and experiences to GitHub.
4. Submit your GitHub repository link to Moodle.
