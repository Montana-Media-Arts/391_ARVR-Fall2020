# Verge 3D

<a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/verge3d" target="_new">Verge3D</a> is an artist-friendly toolkit that allows Blender, 3ds Max, or Maya artists to create immersive web-based experiences. Verge3D can be used to build interactive animations, product configurators, engaging presentations of any kind, online stores, explainers, e-learning content, portfolios, and browser games.

Setting up Virtual Reality

We recommend to enable the Legacy VR option in app creation settings in the App Manager in order to support a wider range of browsers (such as Mozilla Firefox) and devices.

Cardboard devices should work out of the box in any mobile browser, both on Android and iOS.

Google Daydream works in stable Chrome browser on Android phones while HTC and Oculus devices should work in both Chrome and Firefox browsers.

Plese note that WebXR requires a secure context. Verge3D apps must be served over HTTPS/SSL, or from the localhost URL.

The VR mode can be set up for any Verge3D app using enter VR mode puzzle.

Interaction with 3D objects is performed by using the gaze-based reticle pointer automatically provided for VR devices without controllers (such as cardboards).

For VR devices with controllers, interaction is performed by the virtual ray casted from the controllers.

You can use the standard when hovered or when clicked puzzles to capture user events as well as VR-specific on session event.
