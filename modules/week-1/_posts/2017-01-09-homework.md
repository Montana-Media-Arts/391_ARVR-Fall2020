# Homework

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

This week is all about Augment Reality.  I want you to create a couple of experiences and talk about how it went for you. I would like you to take at least two of the tools we discussed and create something.  It's up to you how you want to do it, but I want you to be creative.  Again, we will share your experiences with the class.

1. Use two AR technologies to create AR experiences.
2. Either record the experience on the phone or do a screen capture.
3. Be prepared to talk about your experience.
4. Write a short (1/2 page) paper on how you think AR could be useful in the future.
