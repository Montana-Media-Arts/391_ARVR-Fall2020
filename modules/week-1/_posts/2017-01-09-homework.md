# Homework

This week is an introduction to Augmented Reality. I want you to create a couple of experiences and talk about how it went for you. I would like you to take at least two of the tools we discussed and create something. Itâ€™s up to you how you want to do it, but I want you to be creative. We will share your experiences with the class.

1.	Use two AR technologies to create AR experiences.
2.	Either record the experience on the phone or do a screen capture.
3.	Be prepared to talk about your experience and discuss if they use marker or marker-less AR.
4.	Write a short (1/2 page) paper where you think AR is most useful.
