### Quickstart for Google Cardboard for Unity

This guide shows you how to use the Google Cardboard XR Plugin for Unity for Unity to create your own Virtual Reality (VR) experiences.

**Note:** Make sure to review the Cardboard branding guidelines before distributing your app to a wider audience.

You can use the Cardboard SDK to turn a smartphone into a VR platform. A smartphone can display 3D scenes with stereoscopic rendering, track and react to head movements, and interact with apps by detecting when the user presses the viewer button.

To get started, you'll use HelloCardboard, a demo game that demonstrates the core features of the Cardboard SDK. In the game, users look around a virtual world to find and collect objects. It shows you how to:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Download and build the demo app
3. Scan the QR code of a Cardboard viewer to save its parameters
4. Track the userâ€™s head movements
5. Render stereoscopic images by setting the correct distortion for each eye
6. Set up your development environment

Software requirements:

1. Unity 2019.3.15f1 or later
2. Make sure to include Android and iOS Build Support during installation.
3. Git must be installed and the git executable must be on the PATH environment variable. See Unity's package manager git support docs for more details.
4. Import the SDK and create a new project
