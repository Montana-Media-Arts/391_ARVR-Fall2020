# Homework

This week, we set up our devices for development.  We want to ensure that they work and then customize our first project.

Specifics:

1. Ensure your device is running with Unity
2. Create a simple project with Unity and deploy to your device.
3. Customize the simple project by adding a new object.
4. Write a short paper on your experience.
7. Upload your project and paper to GitHub and turn your link into Moodle.
