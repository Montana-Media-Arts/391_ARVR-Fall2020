# How to make VR apps with Unity and React

It is possible for everyone with enough knowledge to create VR apps, both mobile and web. Unity engine, we’ve already mentioned, is a great tool to create a 360 VR app, like VR Cinema, Titans of Space, Fulldive.

You would need the following set of equipment: Unity3D, Google VR SDK or Android SDK, a camera capable of 360 degrees, an Android phone, and a VR headset. You may find step-by-step instructions and cases at Hackernoon and FreecodeCamp.

As for desktop VR apps, with JavaScript frameworks and tools like ReactVR, WebVR and Node.js we may create virtual reality content viewable in web browsers directly. Yes, it is as simple VR apps as it sounds, with examples like BBC’s Romes, Iberia virtual flight, LearnBrite classroom, Within, Vividly architecture, etc.

To illustrate the possibilities of React to create web VR apps, we’ve made a demo project where we produced a 360-virtual tour for browsers. It took us just 2 days, and for a custom VR app, you’ll need 1 to 3 weeks, using ReactVR.
