# 3D animation in VR

With 3D animation, it’s all about your fantasy and creativity. Unlike in 360-degree videos, where users are limited to viewing, in virtual 3D space, they can move and interact with certain objects.
3D, be it a simple animation, a game, virtual shopping rooms, etc., is a complex trade, but the payoff is worth the effort. In such digital environments, users are free to move, look closely at objects around, interact with them as they would in real life. Take “Clash of Clans 360” game for example.

There are plenty of tools and platforms to create simple virtual 3D environments, such as Maya, Structure Sensor, 3dsMax, LightWave, Modo, Cinema 4D, Houdini, etc. If you want to produce something bigger and more complex, like 3D VR games, you can use game engines like Unity or Unreal, and you would also need Google VR SDK, a headset and an Android phone. With the Unity engine, you can also build 3D models, animations, interior designs.

3D graphics, actually, have multiple forms and expressions, like the following:

* Computer animation
* 3D modeling
* Visual effects
* Product design
* Graphic/motion design
* Visualization for architecture, engineering, etc.
* Stereoscopic 3D effects
